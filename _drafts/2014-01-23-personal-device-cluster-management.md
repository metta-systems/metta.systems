### Managing a network of devices

People have more than one device usually, typical usage includes a laptop, a desktop, a cellphone,
a tablet, a smart tv, a gaming console, sometimes a separate machine at work.

It would be wonderful if all these devices lived in a harmony, keeping track of your daily activities,
providing you with all the necessary information and providing access to any and all materials you
ever needed.

This includes synchronizing various communication histories, web browsing histories, sharing files,
...

So your devices need to know about each other, keep track of joining and leaving devices as well as
learn where the data may soon be requested.
