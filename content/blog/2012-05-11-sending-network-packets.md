A little sidetrack into the world of PCI probing and NE2000 network card emulation.

Wanted to have a taste of sending and receiving network packets inside my little OS, so I went and implemented PCI scanning (extremely simple) and NE2000 card driver (fairly simple too, their doc is quite good although misses some crucial points).

So, after some fiddling I was able to send a packet and receive it through the bochs virtual network card. I've then connected bochs to the host network card and stared at network packets for a while. Cool stuff.

Here's the screen dump of the sent and then received broadcast packet.

```
