In the mean time, I'm slowly rewriting Bryan Ford's SST (Structured Streams Transport) library, using modern C++ and boost.asio, in the hopes that it will be easier to port to Metta. I called it libsss (Structured Secure Streams).

As this work progresses I also plan to enter the description of this protocol into an RFC document, so there will be some reference point for alternative implementations. Current specification progress is available in [libsss repo](https://github.com/berkus/libsss/blob/master/doc/spec.md) on github.

I'd like to take the chance to thank Aldrin D'Souza for his excellent [C++ wrapper around openssl crypto functions](http://aldrin.co/crypto-primitives.html). He kindly licensed it for free use under BSD License.

**update:** Oct 2014 repository moved.
