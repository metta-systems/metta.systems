Here we develop decentralised communication systems for the future, called Metta nodes or uvvies. You can join in by helping us develop, document, promote and use the software.

Check out the blog below for latest updates.

Keep an eye out for upcoming <a href="/downloads">Downloads</a> section that will include Uvvy software built for all major platforms. The software is free as in beer, free as in speech and free as in freedom, so feel free to test it out and provide feedback.

If you're a developer, documentation writer or a keen tester, check out wiki pages on <a href="https://github.com/metta-systems/metta">GitHub</a> for more information how you can help.
