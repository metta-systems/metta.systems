My [Longan Nano board](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Sipeed-Longan-Nano-RISC-V-GD32VF103CBT6-Development-Board-p-4205.html) has arrived and I tried to run Rust on it. It's a great success and here's how.

Nano is a RISC-V microcontroller (GD32VF103) with impressive GPIO capabilities and connectivity - it has a serial, JTAG and USB Type-C ports plus numerous GPIO pins on breakout connectors. It is also very well documented: there are board schematics, CPU and Peripheral datasheets, and numerous programming examples.

I'm on OSX so your mileage may vary. I started from a blog post [here](https://pramode.net/2019/10/07/rust-on-riscv-board-sipeed-longan-nano/).

```sh
git clone https://github.com/pcein/rust-sipeed-longan-nano
```

I use {{ crate(name="cargo-xbuild") }} to build and {{ crate(name="cargo-binutils") }} to perform various object manipulation tasks, so install them first.

```sh
cargo install cargo-xbuild cargo-binutils
```

I added some handy changes to the source code [here](https://github.com/pcein/rust-sipeed-longan-nano/pull/1) - it is not yet merged as of time of this writing.

With these changes in hand you can simply build a debug version of the example using `make`.

Next step is to write it to the device. Nano supports DFU protocol of the USB standard which makes it almost easy. Almost, because you need to build a DFU util with Nano support first.

```sh
git clone git@github.com:riscv-mcu/gd32-dfu-utils.git
cd gd32-dfu-utils
./configure --prefix=/usr/local/opt/gd32-dfu-utils
make install
```

Now you have `/usr/local/opt/gd32-dfu-utils/bin/dfu-util` which you can use to flash your device.

Add the following to your Makefile to make it even easier:

```make
dfu: all
    /usr/local/opt/gd32-dfu-utils/bin/dfu-util -a 0 --dfuse-address 0x08000000:leave -D rust-sipeed-longan-nano.bin
```

Don't forget to use tabs to indent the make commands, otherwise make will complain.

Now actually flashing the device goes as simple as the following:

1. Plug your device using USB Type-C cable to your laptop.
2. Hold BOOT0 button on the device and press RESET0 button once - this will switch the device to DFU mode.
3. Run `make dfu` to download the firmware to the device.

You should see the green LED blinking.

Note that I did not use `riscv-gnu-toolchain` for building as it is generally not required - `cargo-binutils` can do everything by using the LLVM tools.

## JTAG debugger

Since I have a JLink I will write the configuration steps from JLink standpoint.

First of all, figure out the necessary wiring.

```
Func  | JLink Pin | Wire color | Target pin
------+-----------+------------+-----------
TCK   |     9     |   yellow   |   JTCK
TMS   |     7     |   brown    |   JTMS
TDI   |     5     |   green    |   JTDI
TDO   |    13     |   orange   |   JTDO
VTref |     1     |   white    |    3V3
GND   |     4     |   black    |    GND
```

You may choose your own wiring colors of course, I just settled for these and try to keep them consistent between boards.

The OpenOCD for macOS that is bundled with Nano did not work, so I went and built a new one from git.

```sh
git clone git@github.com:riscv-mcu/riscv-openocd.git
# This shall clone you a branch called nuclei-cjtag - check that it did
./configure --enable-jlink --prefix=/usr/local/opt/openocd-425828274-riscv --disable-doxygen-html
make install
```

The config file from bundled openocd is however working, so you can copy it from there. I will post it here to save you unnecessary downloads:

openocd_jlink.cfg:

```tcl
adapter_khz     1000
reset_config srst_only
adapter_nsrst_assert_width 100

interface jlink
jlink usb 0

transport select jtag

set _CHIPNAME riscv
jtag newtap $_CHIPNAME cpu -irlen 5 -expected-id 0x1000563d

set _TARGETNAME $_CHIPNAME.cpu
target create $_TARGETNAME riscv -chain-position $_TARGETNAME
$_TARGETNAME configure -work-area-phys 0x20000000 -work-area-size 20480 -work-area-backup 0


# Work-area is a space in RAM used for flash programming
if { [info exists WORKAREASIZE] } {
   set _WORKAREASIZE $WORKAREASIZE
} else {
   set _WORKAREASIZE 0x5000
}

# Allow overriding the Flash bank size
if { [info exists FLASH_SIZE] } {
    set _FLASH_SIZE $FLASH_SIZE
} else {
    # autodetect size
    set _FLASH_SIZE 0
}

# flash size will be probed
set _FLASHNAME $_CHIPNAME.flash

flash bank $_FLASHNAME gd32vf103 0x08000000 0 0 0 $_TARGETNAME
riscv set_reset_timeout_sec 1
init

halt
```

Place this file SOMEWHERE and add the following target to your Makefile:

```make
ocd:
    /usr/local/openocd-425828274-riscv/bin/openocd -f SOMEWHERE/openocd_jlink.cfg
```

With JLink connected to your machine, run `make ocd` to connect to the device.

```sh
$ make ocd
/usr/local/openocd-425828274-riscv/bin/openocd -f SOMEWHERE/openocd_jlink.cfg

## GDB

I built GDB from the [riscv-gnu-toolchain](http://example.com) sources. While it can step through the instructions and show register contents, it for some reason couldn't properly work with disassembly and source code navigation. I will work more on getting it to work correctly and will update this post when done.

The OpenOCD side at the same time shows GDB connection:

```

Info : device id = 0x19060410
Info : flash_size_in_kb = 0x00000080
Info : flash size = 128kbytes
Info : dropped 'gdb' connection
```

## LLDB

Build instructions based on [sifive/riscv-llvm](https://github.com/sifive/riscv-llvm).

LLDB at this moment DOES NOT SUPPORT riscv, so it cannot be used.

## General GD32VF103 info

[longan-nano-gd32vf103](https://www.susa.net/wordpress/2019/10/longan-nano-gd32vf103/) has lots of information.
