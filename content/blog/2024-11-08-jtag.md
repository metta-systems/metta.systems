To understand how JTAG works I recommend a series of articles by Aliaksandr Kavalchuk. He describes details of the protocol and accompanies the text with amazing illustrations. Check it out:

- [Part 1: Overview](https://medium.com/@aliaksandr.kavalchuk/diving-into-jtag-protocol-part-1-overview-fbdc428d3a16)
- [Part 2: Debugging](https://medium.com/@aliaksandr.kavalchuk/diving-into-jtag-protocol-part-2-debugging-56a566db3cf8)
- [Part 3: Boundary Scan](https://medium.com/@aliaksandr.kavalchuk/diving-into-jtag-part-3-boundary-scan-17f9975ecc59)
- [Part 4: BSDL](https://medium.com/@aliaksandr.kavalchuk/diving-into-jtag-protocol-part-4-bsdl-29fc4081502c)
- [Part 5: Usage Scenarios](https://medium.com/@aliaksandr.kavalchuk/diving-into-jtag-part-5-usage-scenarios-6fd8eda00e08)
- [Part 6: Security](https://medium.com/@aliaksandr.kavalchuk/diving-into-jtag-part-6-security-d40f1e84e6ba)

Also, there are a few articles from other authors, describing JTAG in a more practical way:

- [JTAG Hacking unknown SSD drive controller](https://voidstarsec.com/blog/jtag-pifex)
- [JTAG, SSDs and Firmware Extraction](https://wrongbaud.github.io/posts/jtag-hdd/)
