I want data to be free.

Free from superimposed artificial limitations.

Of course societies have rules, so data which is put into circulation there can be moderated.
But the data seen by someone, cannot.

You can choose to save away and keep your data coming from your interatctions with the world
however you please.

Some people ignore lots of the data and don't care if it's not preserved. Some value every bit of
it and are very upset when some data vanishes, while they have no control to recover, backup and
choose how to store it.

All centralised servers suffer from the "central authority" in keeping or erasing some data you
may have written, but no longer in possession or control of.
